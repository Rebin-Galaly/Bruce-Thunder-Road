        <p class="lyrics">
          The screen door slams, Mary's dress sways <br>
          Like a vision, she dances across the porch as the radio plays<br>
          Roy Orbison singing for the lonely<br>
          Hey, that's me, and I want you only<br>
          Don't turn me home again<br>
          I just can't face myself alone again<br>
          <br>
          Don't run back inside<br>
          Darling, you know just what I'm here for<br>
          So you're scared, and you're thinking<br>
          That maybe we ain't that young anymore<br>
          Show a little faith, there's magic in the night<br>
          You ain't a beauty, but, hey, you're alright<br>
          Oh, and that's alright with me<br>
